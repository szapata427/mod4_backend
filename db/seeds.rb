# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.destroy_all
# Moment.destroy_all
# Picture.destroy_all
#
# user1 = User.create(name: "steven", username: "steven@steven.com", age: 26)
#
# moment1 = Moment.create(title: "First test", description: "testing this if it works", date:12/1/2018, location: "new york" )
#
# picture1= Picture.create(title: "first pic", comment: "test comment", date: 12/01/2018)
